It was also designed to serve as the primary propulsion and maneuvering system of the spacecraft.  </p>

        <p>An investigation into what went wrong with Apollo 13 found that a heating wire inside the liquid oxygen tank had lost its insulation, which led to the explosion. The cause was a combination of mistakes in design, testing, and implementation.  </p>

        <h3>How The Crew Survived</h3>
        <img src=http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/timeline.jpg>
        <p> On April 11, 1970, NASA launched the Apollo 13 mission to send three astronauts to the moon and mark the third manned lunar landing. The mission aimed to send commander Jim Lovell and lunar module pilot Fred Haise to the lunar surface, while command module pilot Jack Swigert remained in orbit. But on April 13, the mission suffered a crippling explosion that would nearly doom the spaceflight and its crew. </p>
