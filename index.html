It was also designed to serve as the primary propulsion and maneuvering system of the spacecraft.  </p>

      <h3>What Went Wrong</h3>
        <img src=http://masterherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/World-of-Warcraft.jpg>
        <p>An investigation into what went wrong with Apollo 13 found that a heating wire inside the liquid oxygen tank had lost its insulation, which led to the explosion. The cause was a combination of mistakes in design, testing, and implementation.  </p>

        <p>First, you want to get your friends and if you have no friends then click the instance finder. Next, select the dungeon or raid you want to do and it will get a group for you. Then when you get in, you will be teleported in.  I am going to cover raids and dungeons first. First, you are in a group where you will go through the obstacles together. You will not get attacked unless you go near so don't disappoint your group with "Ahhh.... they are chasing me... ahhh."  Next, there are bosses at certain points which are harder than normal mobs.  Once you kill the boss you will get armor which you can equip.  And each raid or dungeon is different so if you do not know the fight ask a teammate. They would rather explain than die. Battle grounds are PVP which means you are fighting players and they can attack you at any time, so you need to be ready at any time. Now for the battle grounds. There are three types conquest, capture the flag, arenas, and open world battle grounds. Conquest is where you have to capture the base and keep it there until you get the required amount of points then you win. Capture the flag is where you need to get the bases and capture the flag and bring it back to the base until you get the right amount of points. Now for the open world ones they are many of them and they are harder and very complex and different. So, I can't cover them all. Arenas are when you go into a pit with a few playeres and fight other players and whoever dies first loses.   </p>
