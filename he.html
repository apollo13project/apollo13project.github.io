Launch Vehicle Objectives

 

1.      To launch on a flight azimuth between 72° and 96° and insert the S‑IVB/instrument unit/spacecraft into the planned circular Earth parking orbit. Achieved, despite premature shutdown of the S-II inboard engine.

 

2.      To restart the S‑IVB during either the second or third revolution and inject the S‑IVB/instrument unit/spacecraft into the planned translunar trajectory. Achieved.

 

3.      To provide the required attitude control for the S‑IVB/instrument unit/spacecraft during transposition, docking, and ejection. Achieved.

 

4.      To perform an evasive maneuver after ejection of the command and service module/lunar module from the S‑IVB/instrument unit. Achieved.

 

5.      To attempt to impact the S‑IVB/instrument unit on the lunar surface within 350 kilometers (189 nautical miles) of latitude 3° south, longitude 30° west. Achieved.

 

6.      To determine actual impact point within 5.0 kilometers (2.7 nautical miles) and time of impact within one second. Achieved.

 

7.      To vent and dump the remaining gases and propellants to safe the S‑IVB/instrument unit. Achieved.
