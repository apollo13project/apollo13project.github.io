<h3>Launch Vehicle Objectives</h3>

<p>1.      To launch on a flight azimuth between 72° and 96° and insert the S‑IVB/instrument unit/spacecraft into the planned circular Earth parking orbit. Achieved, despite premature shutdown of the S-II inboard engine.</p>

<p>2.      To restart the S‑IVB during either the second or third revolution and inject the S‑IVB/instrument unit/spacecraft into the planned translunar trajectory. Achieved.</p>

<p>3.      To provide the required attitude control for the S‑IVB/instrument unit/spacecraft during transposition, docking, and ejection. Achieved.</p>

<p>4.      To perform an evasive maneuver after ejection of the command and service module/lunar module from the S‑IVB/instrument unit. Achieved.</p>

<p>5.      To attempt to impact the S‑IVB/instrument unit on the lunar surface within 350 kilometers (189 nautical miles) of latitude 3° south, longitude 30° west. Achieved.</p>

<p>6.      To determine actual impact point within 5.0 kilometers (2.7 nautical miles) and time of impact within one second. Achieved.</p>

<p>7.      To vent and dump the remaining gases and propellants to safe the S‑IVB/instrument unit. Achieved<a href="n.html">.</a></p>
